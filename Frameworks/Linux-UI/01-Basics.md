<h1 style="text-align:center;"> GUI Framework </p>

### Overview

- In Linux Qt and GTK (GIMP Toolkit) are two of the most widely used GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkits.
- These toolkits provide developers with libraries, tools, and APIs to build graphical desktop applications.

### ðŸŸ¦ QT

- Language: Written in C++, but bindings exist for Python (PyQt, PySide), Rust, and others.
- Used by: KDE desktop environment (KDE Plasma), applications like VLC, VirtualBox, and many commercial apps.
- License: Dual-licensed â€” open source (GPL/LGPL) and commercial.
- Cross-platform: Yes â€” works on Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS.
- Features:
  - Powerful widget-based toolkit.
  - Qt Designer: A GUI design tool for building interfaces visually.
  - Support for multimedia, networking, database, OpenGL, and more.
  - Modular and feature-rich with consistent look and feel across platforms.

### ðŸŸ© GTK (GIMP Toolkit)

- Language: Written in C, but has bindings for many other languages (Python with PyGObject, Rust, Vala, etc.).
- Used by: GNOME desktop environment (GNOME Shell), apps like GIMP, Inkscape, GNOME apps.
- License: LGPL â€” open source.
- Cross-platform: Primarily Linux-focused, but also runs on Windows and macOS with some limitations.
- Features:
  - Modern versions use GTK 4 with improved performance and UI capabilities.
  - Integration with GNOME's design philosophy.
  - Support for themes and responsive layouts.
