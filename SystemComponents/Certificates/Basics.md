<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Certificates</p>

### Certificate Authority
* In Linux, CA (Certificate Authority) certificates are used to verify the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates presented by websites, servers, and other services. 
* They are essential for secure communications over HTTPS, TLS, and other encrypted protocols.

### Transport Layer Security
* TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over a network.
* It is widely used in Linux systems for encrypting web traffic (HTTPS), emails, VPNs, and other services.
* TLS is the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and offers improved security and performance.


### Certificate Signing Request
* CSR (Certificate Signing Request) is a file generated when requesting a new SSL/TLS certificate. 
* It contains information about the entity requesting the certificate and is submitted to a Certificate Authority (CA) to obtain a signed certificate.
