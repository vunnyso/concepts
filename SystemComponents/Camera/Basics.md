## Camera devices

In a Linux system, a camera (such as a webcam or external USB camera) is typically managed as a video device and interacts with the system using various subsystems and drivers.

## Camera Frameworks in Linux

- **V4L2 (Video for Linux 2):** The primary subsystem for video devices, including webcams.
- **GStreamer:** A multimedia framework that allows camera streaming and processing.
- **FFmpeg:** Used for capturing, encoding, and streaming video from cameras.
- **OpenCV:** A computer vision library that interacts with cameras for image and video processing.

## Checking if a Camera is Detected

- To see if the system recognizes a camera:

  ```
   # ls /dev/video*
  ```

- To get detailed information about the camera:

  ```
  # v4l2-ctl --list-devices
  ```

- Inspect media devices

  ```
  #  media-ctl -p
  ```

- List of cameras connected

  ```
  #  cam --list
  ```

- Check kernel logs
  ```
  # dmesg | grep -i camera
  ```
