<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Function overloading </p>

### Function Overloading

- Two or more functions declared with the same name
  - Arguments should differ in type and/or number
  - For pointers & reference arguments, qualifiers participate in overload
  - Return type is ignored
  - For member functions, qualifiers participate in overload
- Different implementations of the same behaviour
- The correct implementation is chosen based on the arguments
  This is resolved at compile-time - static polymorphism
- Convenience for the caller, no need to remember different function names

### Name Mangling

- Unique names generated by the compiler for functions
- Allows linker to link the call with the correct overloaded function
- Name mangling algorithm varies from compiler to compiler
- Depends on the type & number of function arguments
- Consequently, C++ functions are not callable from C code

### extern “C”

- Compiler directive applied on global functions and variables
- Suppresses name mangling of the type on which it is applied
- Can be applied only to one function in a set of overloaded functions
- Allows C++ functions to be called from C or other languages
- Example
  ```cpp
  //Apply to both declaration & definition
  extern “C” void Print(const char *message) ;
  ```

```

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int Add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }
extern "C" double Add(double x, double y) { return x + y; }

int main() {
  using namespace std;
  std::cout << "Result of sum is " << Add(1.1, 2.1) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
