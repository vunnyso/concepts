### Permutation
Each of several possible ways in which a set or number of things can be ordered or arranged.
- Order matters here
- Formula P(n,r) = n! รท (n-r)!, where n = total number of objects in the set and r = number of choosing objects from the set.
- Example if we have 6 objects and we choose 3 objects then possible permutations are 120
- P(n,r) = 6! รท (6 - 3)!  = 120

### Combination
A combination is a mathematical technique that determines the number of possible arrangements in a collection of items
- Order does NOT matters here
- Formula C(n,r) = n! รท r! * (n-r)!,  where n = total number of objects in the set and r = number of choosing objects from the set.
- Example if we have 6 objects and we choose 3 objects then possible permutations are 20
- C(n,r) = 6! รท 3! * (6 - 3)!  = 20
