### Overview

- In Monotonic stack maintaining elements in specific order either in increasing or decreasing order.
- Used to solve problems such as finding next greater or smaller element in array.

### Monotonic Increasing stack

- Where all the elements are placed in increasing order from bottom to top.
- Every element added is greater than or equal to one below it.
